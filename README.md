Analysis of Product Data for US states

Here I have done the analysis for Product Data for different product type in 53 different US States. 
This Analysis apply Python concept of Data Visualization and Data exploration using
Plotly, Folium and Seaborn modules.

One way to get the location co-ordinates from city names using Googlemaps module from
Python.
TO get the location co-ordinates from googlemaps, you need to register to get a key and then that key
can be used to extract Latitude and longitude information from City names/Location Names.
